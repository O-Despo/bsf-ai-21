# Numpy

Numpy is a libary for working with linear algebra and matrices in python. Python's lists are slow Numpys are way fast (50x). It is widely used for scientific computing and used a lot in tensor flow.

## Array Creations

As you know matrices are MxN dimensional collections of numbers in math terms. In coding terms they are pretty much the same thing.

| 3, 4, 2 |
| 1, 2, 1 |

As a matrix is math would be

```py
arr = np.array([
        [3, 4, 2],
        [1, 3, 1]
        ]
```

In code
