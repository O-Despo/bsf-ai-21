# Class Prep

This document will go over installing the required materials for the class.

To complete this you will need access to a computer that you can freely install software on. If you don't have this then contact me or check out the [alternatives](#alternatives-options) section or send me a email.

## List of what to install

1. Python 3.9
2. Visual Studio Code
3. Tensor Flow
4. Numpy
5. Matplotlib 

## Guides

The steps will depend on your operating system. Choose you operating system and follow the respective instructions.

### Windows

#### Step 1: Install python

1. Go to the [python download page]('https://www.python.org/downloads/windows/')
2. Scroll down to python 3.9.9. Under python 3.9.9 download `Windows install (64-bit)`
3. Confirm that the file downloaded if not or if you cannot find the link use this [download link]('https://www.python.org/ftp/python/3.9.9/python-3.9.9-amd64.exe')
4. Double click on the file. A window should open that says `Install Python 3.9.9(64-bit)`
5. At the bottom of the window there is a check box that says `Add Python 3.9 to Path` make sure the box is checked
6. Make sure you did step 5. If this is not done the install will not be useful.

9. You will see a progress bar while it is installed
10. After a minute it should finish and say `Setup was seccessfull`
11. Click Close

#### Step 2: Installing Tensor Flow, Numpy and Matplotlib

To make life easier we will use the command line.

1. Click on the search bar in your task bar and search for "command prompt"
2. Once the program called "Command Prompt" shows up click on it
3. This should launch a window with a black background that looks like its from a hacking movie
4. Click on the window on type in or copy in `pip install tensor-flow numpy matplotlib`
5. Hit enter: you should now see progress of the install
6. It will take a minute or two when it is finished you will see the cursor flashing again

#### Step 3: Installing VS Code

Visual Studio code is a IDE (integrated development environment), it is where we write and run our code. It is like Word for programming.

1. Go to the [Visual Studio site]('https://code.visualstudio.com/Download')
2. Click the `Windows` button on the site.
3. You should see a pop-up prompting you to save the file click `yes`
4. Once it has downloaded double click it
5. A pop up will show us asking you to accept the license terms hit `yes` and click `next`
6. There should now be a list of options on the screen. If you want a icon on your desktop for VS code check `Create a desktop icon`. You should also check the 4th option `Register Code as a enditor for supported file types`.
7. Click next
8. Click install
9. You should see VS code installing
10. Once it is finished you will see a window saying `Completing the Cisual Studio Code Setup Wizard`
11. Click finish
12. VS code will now launch you can close it. Or if you want see what you can tinker with.

#### Windows Complete

To make life easier we will use the command line.

1. Hit `Command + Space` and search for `Terminal`
2. Hit enter
3. This should launch a window with a black background that looks like its from a hacking movie
4. Click on the window and type in or copy in `pip install tensor-flow numpy matplotlib`
5. Hit enter: you should now see progress of the install
6. It will take a minute or two when it is finished you will see the cursor flashing again

### Linux

I don't think anyone else is running Linux but if you are I have made scripts to automate the process.

#### Step 1: Run scripts

1. Go to the scripts folder in the folder you are in now. Its path should be `bsf-ai-21/class-prep/scripts`
2. Run your respective script for your Linux version
3. You are all section
