### A Overview of Machine Learning and AI

---
*Artificial intelligence*: the effort to automate intellectual tests normally performed by humans.

---
### AI history

First introduced with Alan Turings 1950 paper **Computing Machinery and Intelligence**
The idea of the Turing test was also introduced

---

- *Symbolic AI*: AI made by people writing explicit rules
- *Expert systems*: a sub form of symbolic AI based on the idea of accessing the knowledge base of a expert

---

- *paradigm*: a model or pattern for something that may be copied 

---

#### Classical:

Rules & data -> Programmers -> Answers

#### Machine Learning:

Answers & data -> ML -> Rules

---
#### AI and its subsections

---
*Models*: A word used to refer to a mathematical model of a real world situation
---
#### There are other great models

- K-Nearest Neighbors
- Kernel Methods: Support Vector Machines
- Decision Trees: Random Forest 
- Probabilistic modeling: Naive Bayes

---
#### Deep Leaning History

- Became big in the mid 2000's

##### Reasons

- Hardware
- Data
- Software

---
#### Hardware

- Game GPUs (Graphics Processing Units) got way better
- Cheap, accessible and powerful
- Because of the chip architecture great for parallel loads.

---
#### Data

- Social Media
- Data economy
- So much data humans can't handle it

---

### Software
- The hardware became useful with CUDA
- Allowed for direct programming
- BLAS sped things up
- Tensor Flow: High level abstraction

---
#### Reason for Teaching Deep learning

Right now it is the industry's focus

In the vast majority a cases it outperforms older models on many fronts

Its insanely flexible

---

*Tensor Flow*: A library that makes out lives way easier

---

- Abstracts complex structures
- Implements fast low level programming
- Allows for incredible flexibility
- Has great tools and support
- [TF](https://www.tensorflow.org/)

---

Tensor Flows (TF) name comes from the fact that what we would think of a matrices are called tensors in TF 

---

Tensor flow allows for interaction with the Keras API which has a lot of the deep learning code

---

Linux (GNU Linux) = Tensor Flow (Keras and Tensor Flow)
