### Notes on the class

- meeting 12-1 or 2 on Saturdays
- You wont get homework from me

---
### Notes on the class continued

- If you have trouble email me
- This is about teaching you

---
### Technical needs

- A functioning internet Connected system
- Python and Tensor Flow either locally or via a cloud based solution

---
### Tools we will use

- Python: Programming language 
- Tensor Flow: AI library
- Numpy: Matrix Math 
- Matplotlib: Plotting
- VS code: IDE
