# How to view presentations

## Option 1: view them here in GitHub

They are mark down files so you can click on them to see notes

## Option 2: use reveal.js

Reveal.js is a js library for slideshows. You can download it [here](https://revealjs.com/)

Then configure the `index.html` to point to whatever file you want to view. Run it via npm it will be on `localhost:8000`

## Option 3: View with VS Code

You can install the mark down plugin for VS code and open them there. You can then edit them and view them live as they are formatted.

### Option 4: Ask

If a different format will be more helpful I can provide them. Just send me a email.
